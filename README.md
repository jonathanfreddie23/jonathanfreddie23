This application streamlines event management tasks, including attendee registration, ticketing, session scheduling, and communication, the events surveys are dynamiccaly created from cms so the survey can be done for any events and multiple types of surveys can done , also some simple yet awesome date checker is implemented to allow or not allow user to use or answer the survey. By creating this app, I have demonstrated my ability to build comprehensive solutions that improve efficiency and enhance the client's event experience.
